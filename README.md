# AstroPrint.com
##### Final Milestone Project by Se√°n Carley
This e-commerce website is intended to allow photographers sell their work 
without the photographer having to host and manage their own site. The site 
will allow users to sign-up and upload a gallery of images that other users 
can view, and purchse. Users are able to leave a comment about any images that 
they purchase.

## UX
AstroPrint.com is intended to provide Astro-Photographers a platform to display 
their work, and allow other users be able to buy the work. The site will also 
allow the users to be able to leave a rating and comments about the sellers 
work etc...
